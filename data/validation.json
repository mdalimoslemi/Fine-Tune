      "instruction": "How do you calculate the total capacitance in series and parallel?",
      "response": "Capacitor combinations have different formulas for series and parallel configurations:\n\n1. Parallel Capacitors:\n- Total capacitance = C1 + C2 + C3 + ...\n- Similar to resistors in series\n- Most common in power supplies\n\n2. Series Capacitors:\n- 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + ...\n- Similar to resistors in parallel\n- Reduces total capacitance\n\n3. Applications:\n- Voltage dividers\n- Filter circuits\n- Timing circuits",

      "instruction": "What is the relationship between voltage, current, and magnetic field in electromagnets?",
      "response": "The relationship follows electromagnetic principles:\n\n1. Basic Relations:\n- Current creates magnetic field (Ampère's Law)\n- Field strength proportional to current\n- Number of coil turns affects field strength\n\n2. Key Equations:\n- B = μ0nI (B: magnetic field, μ0: permeability, n: turns per length, I: current)\n- F = BIL (Force on conductor)\n\n3. Applications:\n- Motors\n- Generators\n- Transformers\n- Solenoids",
